# HR-Employee-Information

In this repository you will find a csv file containing employee information from a company with multiple operations in 3 different cities in India. Along with this file I submitted my MySQL query script as I worked through and analyzed the data. I answered various common HR related questions including  "What is the distribution of educational qualifications among employees?", "Percentage of women and men in each payment tier" and more questions of this nature.
